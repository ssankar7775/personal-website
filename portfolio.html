            <h2>MRacing Formula SAE, Winter 2022</h2>
            <p>As a Formula 1 fanatic, I was excited to join the MRacing project team during my second semester at the University of Michigan.  I joined the Aerodynamics team where I learned the fundamentals of aerodynamic analysis and the importance of downforce on formula cars to optimize controllability through turns.  On this team I had the opportunity to explore NACA airfoil types, and do basic CFD simulations in Star CCM.  However, most of my time on this team was spent learning how to manufacture the composite front and rear wings.  After successfully completing 2 carbon fiber layups, I lead the manufacturing of 10 more carbon fiber layups for the team.  Unfortunatley due to issues with my transfer and course work load, I was unable to adhere to the conflicting meeting and worksessions and left at the end of the semester.</p>

            <h2>Michigan Vertical Flight Technology (MVFT), Model Based Systems Engineering, Fall 2022</h2>
            <p>As part of the first Model Based Systemes Engineering class at the University of Michigan, I learned how to work through MBSE principles and apply them to an external project team, the Michigan Vertical Flight Technology team.  This team is tasked with the objective to design, build, and fly an electric Vertical Take Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehical for Vertical Flight Society's annual competition.  As one of the Model Based Systems Engineers for this team, we were tasked to help the team create concept of operations, detailed requirements, develop Operational Analysis, System Analysis, Logical Architecture, and Physical Architecture using Capella, Cameo and SysML.  We also cunducted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis on our propeller designe to determine the best propeller for our preowned motors from previous flights.  I along with rest of the MBSE team conducted a Systems Requirements Review with industry representatives from Lockheed Martin, Blue Origin, General Atomics, Boeing, and our team sponsors.  Following this SRR, the team later conducted a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) with the same industry representatives and team sponsors where the team's designs, modification, architectures, and verification and validation documents.  Following this PDR, I left the team in pursuit of a leadership position on Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA) as the Aerodynamics and Recover Lead.</p>

            <h2>Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA), Summer 2022 - Summer 2023</h2>
            <p>Following my time with MRacing, I knew that I wanted to focus my time on learnming more about launch vehicals and apply myself on a team where I can hold more ownership of projects.  This team is focused on developing Liquid Bi-propellent rockets to give students experience with industry level rocketry and iterate through previous innovations.  The team has had a series of liquid rockets initially stated under the Tangarine Space Missions (TSM) program; the history of this team and how it's grown in talent through the years is truly increadible and I could talk your ear off about it, so feel free to contact me to learn more.  For now, I'll stick to my time there.                       I joined the team in the summer of 2022 initially working with the seperation and deployment team as well as the Assembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) Team.  During that summer with the ATLO team I learned about rocket plumbing, how to read P&IDs and how to work with solonoids, Swagelok, NPT, and AN fittings.  I participated in Coldflow campaigns conducting leak checks and ensurid that pluming was properly LOx cleaned and stored safely. As part of the Aerodynamics and Recovery team, I joined as the team was testing the separation and deployment mechanism meant to seperate the nosecone from the body of the rocket to deploy the recovery parachutes.  The original system was a one foot piston with a 1" diameter which would actuate due to a pyrotechnic bolt at the base of the piston.  The initial tests were done by fitting a 1/8" bolt which had a piece of shrink wrap with black powder and an ematch.  The first series of tests was to determine how much black powder was needed to actuate the piston to displace 30 lbf.  However there were inconsistancies in the firing of the bolt as the shrink wrap would clog the opening due to the heat from the balck powder.  I took ownership of improving the system by using a combustable paper to house the balck powder and wrote detailed standard operating procedures for the manufacturing and testing for the pyrobolts and introduced a black powder training which was approved by the facility's Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Officer. Following the implementation of these protocols, I became the project lead for the Seperation and Deployment mechanism. After various iterations of plumbing and safety additions to the mechanism, the pyrotechnic mechanism continued to be inconsistant and unreliable.  With a fast approaching deadline for integration and launch and pressure from the rest of the team, I started to design a pneumatic system on my own that would be quick to assemble and developed a demonstration of concept for the team within 2 weeks. Although the team was skeptical of moving to a new design clost to the deadline, I held an emergancy design review and had all hands on deck from the whole team to set the pneumatic system into action. I designed the system with a NPT T-fitting from the piston, with an orofice and relief falve on one end and an attatchment to a solonoid on the other end.  An accumulater was manufactured by the ATLO team due to the expedited timeline of the mechanism which fit upstream of the solonoid.  The Accumulator pressure was designed to hold a maximum pressure of 1100 psi with a safety factor of 1.3 due to sizing and mass constraints.  This system was tested repeatedly and rigourously and was successfull on all tests from component to system testing.  Unfourtunatly due to an avionics batteery fire just following the launch from the launch rail, the rocket lost all telemetrey and was unable to actuate the recovery mechanism's solonoid to deploy the parachutes. </p>
