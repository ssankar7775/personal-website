            <h2>MRacing Formula SAE, Winter 2022</h2>
            <p>As a Formula 1 fanatic, I was excited to join the MRacing project team during my second semester at the University of Michigan.  I joined the Aerodynamics team where I learned the fundamentals of aerodynamic analysis and the importance of downforce on formula cars to optimize controllability through turns.  On this team I had the opportunity to explore NACA airfoil types, and do basic CFD simulations in Star CCM.  However, most of my time on this team was spent learning how to manufacture the composite front and rear wings.  After successfully completing 2 carbon fiber layups, I lead the manufacturing of 10 more carbon fiber layups for the team.  Unfortunatley due to issues with my transfer and course work load, I was unable to adhere to the conflicting meeting and worksessions and left at the end of the semester.</p>
