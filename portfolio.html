            <h2>MRacing Formula SAE</h2>
            <h3>Winter 2022</h3>
            <p>As a Formula 1 enthusiast, I eagerly joined the MRacing project team during my second semester at the University of Michigan. I joined the Aerodynamics team, where I acquired the foundational knowledge of aerodynamic analysis and comprehended the pivotal role of downforce in optimizing the controllability of formula cars during turns. Within this team, I had the privilege of exploring various NACA airfoil types and conducting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations utilizing Star CCM. However, the majority of my time was dedicated to mastering the manufacturing process of composite front and rear wings. After successfully completing two carbon fiber layups, I spearheaded the production of ten more carbon fiber layups for the team. Regrettably, due to unforeseen complications with my transfer and course load, I was unable to reconcile conflicting meeting and work schedules and ultimately departed the team at the conclusion of the semester. </p>

            <h2>Michigan Vertical Flight Technology (MVFT), Model Based Systems Engineering</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2022</h3>
            <p>As a part of the inaugural Model-Based Systems Engineering course at the University of Michigan, I acquired the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively apply MBSE principles to an external project team, the Michigan Vertical Flight Technology team. This team was entrusted with the objective of designing, constructing, and operating an electric Vertical Take Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle for the Vertical Flight Society’s annual competition. As a Model-Based Systems Engineer for this team, my responsibilities included assisting the team in developing a comprehensive concept of operations, meticulously defining detailed requirements, and subsequently creating Operational Analysis, System Analysis, Logical Architecture, and Physical Architecture utilizing Capella, Cameo, and SysML. Additionally, we conducted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis on our propeller designs to ascertain the optimal propeller design for our preowned motors derived from previous flights.</p>
            <p>In collaboration with the MBSE team, I participated in a Systems Requirements Review (SRR) with esteemed industry representatives from Lockheed Martin, Blue Origin, General Atomics, Boeing, and our team sponsors. Subsequently, the team conducted a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) with the same industry representatives and team sponsors, during which the team’s designs, modifications, architectures, and verification and validation documentation were meticulously scrutinized. Following this PDR, I assumed a leadership role within the Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA) as the Aerodynamics and Recovery Lead.</p>

            <h3>Summer 2022 - Summer 2023</h3>
            <p>Following my tenure with MRacing, I recognized the opportunity to redirect my focus toward learning more about launch vehicles and taking on a more project-oriented role within a team. <a href="https://masa.engin.umich.edu/Admin/" target="_blank">MASA</a> is dedicated to developing Liquid Bi-propellent rockets, providing students with practical experience in industry-level rocketry and facilitating the iteration of previous innovations. The team has a history of liquid rockets initially conceived under the Tangarine Space Missions (TSM) program, and I could elaborate on their remarkable journey and growth in talent over the years. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me for further information.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2022, I initially joined the team working with the Aerodynamics and Recovery team, working on a few projects such as the manufacturing of composite structures (fins and avionics/recovery bay) as well as the Separation and Deployment mechanism, which I thereafter took ownership of.  I also worked with the Assembly Test and Launch Operation (ATLO) Team, where I gained valuable experiences in rocket plumbing by learning how to interpret P&IDs and operate with solenoids, Swagelok, NPT, and AN fittings.  With the ATLO team, I also participated in Coldflow campaigns, conducting leak checks and ensuring that plumbing was properly cleaned and stored safely. </p>
            <p>Following the summer of working with the recovery, composites, and fins team, I was named project lead of all three projects and continued the development of each project until launch integration.  After 3 months of being project lead, I was named the Aerodynamics and Recovery lead for the last 6 months of the Clementine project where I oversaw 40 people among 11 different projects until launch integration.  Following the launch of Clementine, I was the Marketing lead for three months after which I had to reevaluate my priorities and focus on my academic pursuits.</p>

            <h3>Clementine's Seperation and Deployment Mechanism</h3>
            <p>As part of the Aerodynamics and Recovery team, I joined as the team conducted tests on the separation and deployment mechanism designed to separate the nosecone from the rocket body and deploy the recovery parachutes. The initial system consisted of a one-foot piston with a 1” diameter, actuated by a pyrotechnic bolt at its base. The initial tests involved fitting a 1/8” bolt with a piece of shrink wrap filled with black powder and an ematch. The primary objective was to determine the amount of black powder required to actuate the piston and displace 30 lbf. However, inconsistencies arose due to the shrink wrap clogging the opening caused by the heat generated by the black powder.  In response to the need for system improvement, I assumed ownership of the combustible paper housing for black powder and developed comprehensive standard operating procedures for pyrotechnic manufacturing and testing. Additionally, I introduced a black powder training program, which was approved by the facility’s Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Officer.</p>
            <p>Following the implementation of these protocols, I became the project lead for the Separation and Deployment mechanism. Despite various iterations of plumbing and safety enhancements, the pyrotechnic mechanism continued to exhibit inconsistencies and unreliability.</p>
            <p>Under pressure from the impending deadline and the rest of the team, I embarked on a self-directed design project for a pneumatic system. Within two weeks, I presented a conceptual demonstration to the team. Although the team expressed reservations about adopting a new design so close to the deadline, I convened an emergency design review to ensure everyone’s participation in setting up the pneumatic system.</p>
            <p>The system was designed with a NPT T-fitting from the piston, featuring an outlet and relief valve on one end and a solenoid attachment on the other. An accumulator was manufactured by the ATLO team due to the expedited timeline of the mechanism and was positioned upstream of the solenoid. The accumulator pressure was designed to maintain a maximum of 1100 psi with a safety factor of 1.3, considering size and mass constraints.</p>
            <p>The system underwent rigorous testing and proved successful in all component and system evaluations. Regrettably, an avionics battery fire occurred shortly after the rocket’s launch from the launch rail, resulting in the loss of telemetry and the inability to activate the recovery mechanism’s solenoid, triggering the deployment of the parachutes.</p>

            <h2>Human Powered Submarine</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2023 - Summer 2024</h3>
            <p>During my senior year, I joined the Human Powered Submarine (HPS) team with the intention of providing advisory support to younger students in assembling a team with strong engineering principles while prioritizing my academic pursuits. The HPS team is dedicated to constructing a flooded submarine capable of navigating intricate obstacle courses and speed races through the utilization of the pilot’s power. The submarine is entered into the European International Submarine Race (eISR) and the International Submarine Race (ISR) during alternate years. This year, the team embarked on a project to design, construct, and manufacture a new submarine named Marlin to compete in eISR. The team comprised 15 students, including five non-engineer divers and only four upperclassmen with prior engineering experience.</p>
            <p>Given the existing leadership within the team, I joined to impart knowledge on utilizing CAD software, specifically SolidWorks and NX, and guide the team’s transition from Dassault System’s software to Siemens. This transition enabled the team to access the University’s teamcenter license for sharing large files. In addition to software instruction, I also imparted guidance on proper General Dimensioning and Tolerance (GD&T) standards and first principles engineering.</p>
            <p>After several months, I recognized my ability to contribute more effectively to the team and assumed a smaller project. This project involved designing, manufacturing, and constructing a tensioner system for the drive train, ensuring its accessibility to the divers. During this process of manufacturing the tensioner, I trained a younger student on using a mill and gained experience on lathes.</p>
