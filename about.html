        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Tosh Sankar, an Aerospace Engineer driven by solving complex challenges and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Growing up near Detroit, my fascination with automotive engineering led me to aerospace after seeing SpaceX's Falcon 9 landing. I focus on systems engineering, avionics, and rapid prototyping.</p>

        <p>In high school I developed CAD, programming, and robotics skills through IB coursework and extracurriculars. After beginning at Western Michigan University, I transferred to the University of Michigan to pursue hands-on project work and leadership opportunities.</p>

        <p>At U‑M I joined teams such as MASA and the CubeSat Flight Lab, taking roles in design, integration, and systems engineering. These projects taught me rigorous testing, documentation, and effective team coordination.</p>

        <p>My background spans spacecraft subsystems, composite manufacturing, and avionics — I enjoy turning complex requirements into practical, testable systems.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I earned my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan after initially starting my studies at Western Michigan University, where I was recognized on the Dean’s List. My education focused on key areas such as Aerodynamics, Spacecraft Dynamics, and Propulsion, complemented by hands-on experience with advanced engineering projects like Amature Liquid Rocketry, CubeSat development, and human-powered submarine design.

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about music and love expressing myself through it. I play the piano, flute, and guitar, and I enjoy exploring a wide range of genres, from symphonies to Country and hip-hop. Creating my own beats is a fun way for me to escape and unleash my creativity. I'm also an avid runner and recently completed a half marathon, with plans to tackle a full marathon next year. Additionally, I'm a huge Formula 1 fan, especially when it comes to Lewis Hamilton, and I find joy in getting lost in a good book.</p>
