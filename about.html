        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Tosh Sankar, an Aerospace Engineer driven by solving complex challenges and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Growing up near Detroit, my fascination with the automotive industry sparked an early interest in engineering, especially in the aerodynamics and performance of high-speed cars. However, it wasn’t until I witnessed SpaceX’s Falcon 9 landing that I became inspired by the idea of making the impossible possible through aerospace engineering.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;" style="margin-left: 34444;">In high school, I honed my skills in CAD, programming, and robotics while challenging myself in the International Baccalaureate program, where I tackled open-ended problems with creativity and determination. Despite setbacks in grades due to my involvement in extracurriculars, I stayed focused on my goal of pursuing aerospace engineering. After initially attending Western Michigan University, I transferred to the University of Michigan, driven by my passion to gain hands-on experience and work with project teams.</p>
            
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">At U of M, I immersed myself in project teams like MASA and the CubeSat Flight Lab, where I took on leadership roles and tackled technical challenges in design, integration, and systems engineering. Balancing coursework and my project commitments required significant time management, but I learned to prioritize effectively, eventually finding a way to integrate my hands-on experience with my academic pursuits.</p>
            
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Through these experiences, I’ve developed strong leadership skills, resilience, and a deep understanding of engineering principles that go beyond the classroom. I’m excited to apply my background in systems design, avionics, and mechanical systems to make an impact in the aerospace field and contribute to the advancement of space exploration.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about music and love expressing myself through it. I play the piano, flute, and guitar, and I enjoy exploring a wide range of genres, from symphonies to Country and hip-hop. Creating my own beats is a fun way for me to escape and unleash my creativity. I'm also an avid runner and recently completed a half marathon, with plans to tackle a full marathon next year. Additionally, I'm a huge Formula 1 fan, especially when it comes to Lewis Hamilton, and I find joy in getting lost in a good book.</p>
