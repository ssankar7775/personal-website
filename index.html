            <h2>About Me</h2>            
            <p>Hi! I’m Tosh Sankar, a recent Aerospace Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in spacecraft systems design, project leadership, and a focus on communications, avionics, 3D printing, and mechanical systems. I’m passionate about advancing space and defense systems and am committed to making space more accessible through innovative engineering solutions.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">My journey into Aerospace Engineering began in 2015 with a fortuitous glimpse of SpaceX’s historic Falcon 9 landing. This moment sparked my ambition to contribute to sustainable, more accessible space exploration and infrastructure for groundbreaking scientific research.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">At the University of Michigan, I had the privilege of working on diverse project teams, including MASA (Michigan Aeronautical Science Association), where I honed my skills in composite materials and mechanical design, and the CubeSat Flight Lab, where I applied Model-Based Systems Engineering practices.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Explore this website to see more about my projects, and feel free to download my resume below.

                <h3>Project 1: MASA’s Clementine Rocket Separation Deployment Mechanism</h3>
                <p>As the Lead for the Aerodynamics and Recovery team in the <a href="https://masa.engin.umich.edu/Admin/" target="_blank">Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA)</a>, I was responsible for designing, manufacturing, testing, and integrating the Separation Deployment Mechanism. This mechanism facilitated the separation of our composite nose cone from the recovery bay to enable the deployment of the drogue and main parachutes. Originally, we implemented a pyrotechnic system actuating a piston, but safety concerns prompted me to establish rigorous safety protocols, training procedures, and detailed testing plans. Given the lack of reliability and repeatability, I initiated a redesign, transitioning to a pneumatic system under an expedited launch timeline. This adaptation led to successful ground tests and was integrated into the rocket. Although the launch encountered challenges with battery issues that prevented solenoid actuation, we conducted thorough post-launch analysis, identifying key lessons for future improvement.</p>

                <h3>Project 2: CubeSat Flight Lab at the University of Michigan</h3>
                <p>As a Systems Engineer for the <a href="https://cubesat.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">CubeSat Flight Lab</a>, I collaborated with a diverse team of 36 students to lay the groundwork for Michigan’s research CubeSat, Michigan Cubed-10 (MC-10). Over three semesters, I led systems engineering efforts for three iterations of High-Altitude Balloon (HAB) StratoSats, focusing on enhancing functionality, optimizing states and modes, and reducing mass with each prototype. My role involved developing the Concept of Operations, defining and refining requirements, conducting trade studies, and managing Interface Control Documents (ICDs). I also led the development of testing and launch protocols to ensure each iteration met mission objectives, contributing to the long-term vision for a fully space-capable system.</p>

                <h3>Project 3: Human Powered Submarine</h3>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.hps.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Human Powered Submarine</a> team competes internationally in events like the American and European <a href="https://internationalsubmarineraces.org/" target="_blank">International Submarine Races</a>, creating submarines capable of navigating underwater obstacle courses. As a member of the Propulsion and Hull Design team, I advised new team members in CAD software, including SolidWorks and NX, and leveraged my composite manufacturing expertise to establish Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that reduced hull production time from two weeks to five days. I designed, manufactured, and integrated a tensioner system for our gear-based pulley setup to minimize chain skipping and improve adjustability in underwater conditions, supporting both ease of maneuverability and operational safety for our dive team.</p>
